			Hello
			The Coast Guard cutter Polar Star keeps shipping lanes open in the North and South Poles. When it cuts through the ice, it can feel like an earthquake on board. But Coast Guard Vice Adm. Fred Midgette warns the U.S. is being outspent by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has six new heavy icebreakers.

			"If you look at what Russia is doing, there's almost a mini arms buildup going on in the Arctic," said Midgette.

			Meanwhile, the 40-year-old Polar Star, the only heavy icebreaker in the Coast Guard's fleet, is near the end of its life. 

			The ship was commissioned in 1976. When asked how many icebreakers have been built by the Coast Guard since, he responded "zero."
